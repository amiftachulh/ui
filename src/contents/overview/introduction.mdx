title: Introduction
description: A collection of headless components styled with Panda CSS.
---

UI is inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and using [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/) as the base CSS framework.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste to your apps.

**What do you mean not a component library?**

It means you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm, with no plans to publish it.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
